        To add a new template, press above _Add_.


        Templates give you the ability to define typical, recurring shifts
        within a week. A Shift is the number of demands and possibly needed
        qualifications.


        Example 1: @08:00-16:00 2 x cook in team kitchen@


        Example 2: @14:00-22:00 2 x in team service@


        After the creation of a template you can use it in every plan to
        easily fill your plan with the predefined demands.
