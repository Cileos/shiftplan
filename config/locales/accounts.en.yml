        Please enter the name of the new account and name the first

        For every account we create a separate employee. So we can guarantee,
        that all your accounts don't share information.
        You can either copy an existing name or just use a different one.

        introducing additional costs when Clockwork starts requiring a fee.

        Before this event though, we will notice and inform you so you can
        decide calmly whether you want to subscribe to a package with costs.
