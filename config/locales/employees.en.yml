        Want to give more rights to an employee? Select the _Planner_ role. _Planner_ can, unlike other employees,
        manage staff, teams, plans and appointments. The Unit owner cannot be changed and you cannot change your
        role by yourself. 


        If you want an employee to be able to log into Clockwork, then you need to invite them first.
        Click on the _Invite_ button and enter their e-mail address. The employee must accept the invitation
        and Clockwork will store that e-mail for future use.
       
        All employees who log using their e-mail you provided will have "Active" status on this page.
