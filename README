== Welcome to Clockwork

Use it. Enjoy it. Love it.

== Developer Notes

=== Ember Rewrite 2015

We set the goal to reimplement the bigger part of clockwork as a single-page
Ember app. Because we want to use Rails as a JSON-backend and for CSS
generation, we mix it in using the `ember-cli-rails` gem and deploy them with a
little magic.

As long as both are in separate repositories, you must clone it somewhere else
and give Rails a hint for its location:

    export CLOCKWORK_EMBER_ROOT="~/work/clockwork-js"
    git clone github.com:Cileos/clockwork-js $CLOCKWORK_EMBER_ROOT
    # restart rails

=== Development VM

Setup: install virtualbox and vagrant

`vagrant up` # wait ~15min

Something broken? Repair it and start over:

`vagrant destroy && vagrant up`

Edit the files from your Machine, run the following to keep VM up-to-date

`vagrant rsync-auto` in an extra terminal

Go into the machine (for server, bundle, migrate etc)

`vagrant ssh` then `cd clockwork/`

Cucumber @javascripts can only be run with kopflos, and maybe not even that.
Niklas needs a mac for an hour to try X-Forwarding Apple-style.
