== Welcome to Clockwork

Use it. Enjoy it. Love it.

== Developer Notes

=== Development VM

Setup: install virtualbox and vagrant

`vagrant up` # wait ~15min

Something broken? Repair it and start over:

`vagrant destroy && vagrant up`

Edit the files from your Machine, run the following to keep VM up-to-date

`vagrant rsync-auto` in an extra terminal

Go into the machine (for server, bundle, migrate etc)

`vagrant ssh` then `cd clockwork/`

Cucumber @javascripts can only be run with kopflos, and maybe not even that.
Niklas needs a mac for an hour to try X-Forwarding Apple-style.

See Volksplaner::FormButtons for buttons to use in you forms.
