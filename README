== Developer Notes

=== Forms

Because we use jQuery Mobile, all Forms will be submitted through AJAX but still expect HTML back. To Use Rails' ajaxified forms, you must
* add remote: true to enable Rails' ajax form handling
* add a html data-ajax attribute with value "false" to disable jQmobile

Example:

    = simple_form_for scheduling, url: plan_schedulings_path(scheduling.plan), remote: true, html: { 'data-ajax' => false } do |f|
      = f.input :quicky


=== Cucumber stepfinder ===
