=== Forms

Because we use jQuery Mobile, all Forms will be submitted through AJAX but still expect HTML back. To Use Rails' ajaxified forms, you must
* add remote: true to enable Rails' ajax form handling
* add a html data-ajax attribute with value "false" to disable jQmobile

Example:

    = simple_form_for scheduling, url: plan_schedulings_path(scheduling.plan), remote: true, html: { 'data-ajax' => false } do |f|
      = f.input :quicky


=== Segmentation faults on Mac Systems ===

ruby version: ruby 1.8.7 (2011-06-30 patchlevel 352) [i686-darwin10.8.0]
nokogiri version: 1.8
nokogiri linked against libxml2 version 2.7.7 (try nokogiri -v)

If found this issue on github: https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/issues/541

The following steps solved my problem:

If you are getting undeterministic Segmentations faults on your MacOs System, especially in
/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/nokogiri-1.5.0/lib/nokogiri/xml/node.rb:821, you should try to update 
your libxml2 version to a version >= 2.7.8 with homebrew and then tell nokogiri to link against 
this updated libxml2 version as follows:

$ brew install libxml2

$ brew link libxml2

# explicitly tell nokogiri to use you homebrew libxml2 (in my case version 2.7.8) rather than the system's libxml2 by 
# either updating the bundle config and bundle after that:

$ bundle config build.nokogiri --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.8/include/libxml2 --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.8/lib
$ bundle install

# or:

$ gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.8/include/libxml2 --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.8/lib

If everything worked, try

$ nokogiri -v

The output should look like the following and it should show the updated libxml version (in my case 2.7.8):

# Nokogiri (1.5.0)
