= Tutorial

Provides a rails engine for an Ember-powered tutorial. It should have a map, a
lot of examples and maybe even achievements. We chose to embed it via an iframe
so the DOM ids of the map will not clash with the rest of the page. Still, we
want to highlight elements on the main page from within the tutorial.
