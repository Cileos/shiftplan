= Tutorial

Provides a rails engine for an Ember-powered tutorial. It should have a map, a
lot of examples and maybe even achievements. We chose to embed it via an iframe
so the DOM ids of the map will not clash with the rest of the page. Still, we
want to highlight elements on the main page from within the tutorial.


== How to add a new step

How to include a new step in the existing tutorial. In this example, we will
use the name "drinking", which gives instructions how to get drunk really
quick.

1. Draw the step onto the map.svg, give it an id of "tutorial_step_drinking".
2. Add an entry with `id: drinking` to i18n files for all locales under `tutorial.chapters`
3. In the controller, add `tutorial 'drinking', only: [:new, :index]` for the
   actions were the tutorial should be available (it takes the same arguments
   as `before_filter`

When you now visit the page for the controller and click the `tutorial`-button,
it should open in your freshly created chapter.
