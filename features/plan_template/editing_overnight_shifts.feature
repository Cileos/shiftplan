Feature: Editing overnight shifts of plan templates
  As a planner
  I want to edit the overnight shifts of my plan templates
  In order to be able to change the demands which exist for a typical work week in my organization

  Background:
    Given mr burns, owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant exists
      And a plan template exists with name: "Typische Woche", template_type: "weekbased", organization: the organization
      And a default overnight shift for the plan template exists
      And I am signed in as the user "mr burns"


  Scenario: Editing the timespan of overnight shifts by clicking on the second day
    Given I am on the teams in week page for the plan template
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Teams                  | Mo  | Di                                     | Mi                                     | Do  | Fr  | Sa  | So  |
        | Brennstabkessel(B)     |     |                                        |                                        |     |     |     |     |
        | Druckwasserreaktor(D)  |     | 22:00-06:00 3 x 2 x Brennstabpolierer  | 22:00-06:00 3 x 2 x Brennstabpolierer  |     |     |     |     |

     When I click on the early shift "22:00-06:00"
      And I wait for the modal box to appear
     Then the "Startzeit" field should contain "22:00"
      And the "Endzeit" field should contain "06:00"
     When I schedule shift "21-7"
      And I press "Speichern"
      And I wait for the modal box to disappear
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Teams                  | Mo  | Di                                     | Mi                                     | Do  | Fr  | Sa  | So  |
        | Brennstabkessel(B)     |     |                                        |                                        |     |     |     |     |
        | Druckwasserreaktor(D)  |     | 21:00-07:00 3 x 2 x Brennstabpolierer  | 21:00-07:00 3 x 2 x Brennstabpolierer  |     |     |     |     |

  Scenario: Editing the team of overnight shifts
    Given I am on the teams in week page for the plan template
      And I click on the late shift "22:00-06:00"
      And I wait for the modal box to appear
     When I select "Brennstabkessel" from "Team"
      And I press "Speichern"
      And I wait for the modal box to disappear
     Then I should see the following calendar:

        | Druckwasserreaktor(D)  |     |                                        |                                        |     |     |     |     |

  Scenario: Deleting demands of overnight shifts
