Feature: Editing overnight shifts of plan templates
  As a planner
  I want to edit the overnight shifts of my plan templates
  In order to be able to change the demands which exist for a typical work week in my organization

  Background:
    Given the situation of a just registered user
      And a plan template exists with name: "Typische Woche", template_type: "weekbased", organization: the organization
      And the following teams exist:
        | team                | name                | organization      |
        | Brennstabkessel     | Brennstabkessel     | the organization  |
        | Druckwasserreaktor  | Druckwasserreaktor  | the organization  |
      And the following qualifications exist:
        | qualification      | name               | organization      |
        | Brennstabpolierer  | Brennstabpolierer  | the organization  |
        | Brennstabexperte   | Brennstabexperte   | the organization  |
     When I go to the teams in week page for the plan template
      And I click on cell "Di"/"Druckwasserreaktor(D)"
      And I wait for the modal box to appear
     When I select "22" from "Startstunde"
      And I select "15" from "Startminute"
      And I select "6" from "Endstunde"
      And I select "45" from "Endminute"
      And I fill in "Anzahl" with "2"
      And I select "Brennstabpolierer" from "Qualifikation"
      And I follow "Anforderung hinzuf√ºgen"
      And I fill in the 2nd "Anzahl" with "3"
      And I press "Anlegen"
      And I wait for the modal box to disappear
      And I should see the following calendar:
