Feature: Creating shifts for plan templates
  As a planner
  I want to create shifts for my plan template
  In order to be able to define demands which exist for a typical work week in my organization

  Background:
    Given the situation of a just registered user
      And the following teams exist:
        | team                | name                | organization      |
        | Brennstabkessel     | Brennstabkessel     | the organization  |
        | Druckwasserreaktor  | Druckwasserreaktor  | the organization  |
      And a plan template exists with name: "Typische Woche", template_type: "weekbased", organization: the organization

  Scenario: Visit the teams in week page of a plan template
    Given I go to the plan templates page for the organization
     Then I should see the following table of plan_templates:
        | Name            | Vorlagentyp    |
        | Typische Woche  | Wochenbasiert  |

     When I follow "Typische Woche" within the first table row
     Then I should be on the teams in week page for the plan template
      And I should see the following calendar:
        | Teams                 | Mo  | Di  | Mi  | Do  | Fr  | Sa  | So  |
        | Brennstabkessel(B)    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
