Feature: Inviting Employees
  As a planner
  I want to invite my employees
  So that they can see when they have to work and can comment on plans and shifts

  Scenario: Inviting an employee
    Given a planner "me" exists with email: "planner@fukushima.jp"
    And an organization "fukushima" exists with name: "Fukushima", planner: planner "me"
      And an employee exists with organization: organization "fukushima", first_name: "Homer"
      And a plan exists with organization: the organization, name: "Schicht im Schacht"
     When I sign in as the planner "me"
     Then I should be signed in as "planner@fukushima.jp" for the organization
     When I follow "Mitarbeiter"
     When I follow "Homer"
      And I follow "Bearbeiten"
      And I follow "Mitarbeiter einladen"
     When I fill in "E-Mail" with "homer@thesimpsons.com"
      And I press "Einladung verschicken"
     Then I should see flash notice "Die Einladung wurde erfolgreich verschickt."
      And I should be on the edit page for the employee
      And "homer@thesimpsons.com" should receive an email with subject "Sie wurden zu Shiftplan eingeladen"

     When I open the email
      And I follow "Einladung akzeptieren" in the email
      And I fill in "Passwort" with "secret!"
      And I fill in "Passwort best√§tigen" with "secret!"
      And I press "Passwort setzen"
     Then I should be signed in as "homer@thesimpsons.com" for the organization
      And I should be on the dashboard page
      And I should see "Schicht im Schacht"
