Feature: Notification Hub
  As a user
  I want to see all my notification in the notification hub
  In order to not miss important events

  Background:
    Given mr burns, owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant exists
      And a confirmed user "bart" exists
      And an employee "bart" exists with first_name: "Bart", account: the account, user: the confirmed user "bart"
      And the employee "bart" is a member of the organization
      And I am signed in as the user "mr burns"


  Scenario: Notification hub is updated
     When I go to the home page
      And a post exists with blog: the blog, author: employee "bart", title: "Umweltminister zu Besuch", body: "Bitte putzen"
      And a plan exists with organization: the organization
      And a scheduling exists with employee: employee "mr burns", plan: the plan
      And a comment exists with commentable: the post, employee: the employee "bart", body: "Ich bringe einen Besen mit"
      And a comment exists with commentable: the scheduling, employee: the employee "bart", body: "Bitte Reaktor abschließen nach Dienstende"
      And the notification hub should have no unseen notifications

     When all the delayed jobs are invoked
      And the time interval for updating the count of the notification hub elapses
     Then the notification hub should have 3 unseen notifications
     When I follow "3" within the notification hub
      And I wait for the notifications spinner to disappear
     Then the notification hub should have no unseen notifications
      And the page should not be titled "(3)"
      But the notification hub should have unread notifications
      And I should see a list of the following notifications:
       | subject      | blurb                                                                    |
       | Bart Simpson | hat Ihre Schicht kommentiert: "Bitte Reaktor abschließen n..."           |
       | Bart Simpson | hat "Umweltminister zu Besuch" kommentiert: "Ich bringe einen Besen mit" |
       | Bart Simpson | hat "Umweltminister zu Besuch" geschrieben: "Bitte putzen"               |
     When I follow "Umweltminister zu Besuch" within the notification hub
     Then I should be on the page of the post
     When I open the notification hub menu
      And I wait for the notifications spinner to disappear
      # notification was marked as read and is not displayed in the hub anymore
     Then I should see a list of the following notifications:
       | subject      | blurb                                                                    |
       | Bart Simpson | hat Ihre Schicht kommentiert: "Bitte Reaktor abschließen n..."           |
       | Bart Simpson | hat "Umweltminister zu Besuch" geschrieben: "Bitte putzen"               |

       | Bart Simpson | hat "Umweltminister zu Besuch" geschrieben: "Bitte putzen" |
      But I should not see "Alles erledigt" within the notification hub
     When I follow "Als gelesen markieren" within the notification hub
      And I wait for the notifications spinner to disappear
     Then the notification hub should not have unread notifications
      And I should not see "Umweltminister zu Besuch" within the notification hub
      But I should see "Alles erledigt" within the notification hub

     # the notification on the dashboard is still there and _looks_ unread
     When I follow "Umweltminister zu Besuch" within the notifications module
     Then I should be on the page of the post
