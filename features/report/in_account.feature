      # Foreign account data:
      And an account "tv business" exists with name: "TV Business"
      And a organization "the clown show" exists with account: account "tv business", name: "The Clown Show"
      And a plan "make fun of homer" exists with organization: organization "the clown show", name: "Make fun of homer"
      And an employee "krusty" exists with first_name: "Krusty", last_name: "Krustofski"
      And the employee "krusty" is a member of the organization "the clown show"
      # Krusty's scheduling should not show up in the report of the springfield
      # account as it belongs to the foreign tv business account.
      And the following schedulings exists:
        | date        | employee                   | quickie  | plan                      |
        | 18.12.2012  | employee "krusty"          | 9-9:30   | plan "make fun of homer"  |

     When I go to the dashboard page
      And I follow "Report"
      # Schedulings of both organizations of the springfield account are listed.
      # Per default only the schedulings of the current month are listed.
     Then I should see the following table of reports:
        | Datum       | Stunden  | Ganzt√§gig  | Mitarbeiter     | Team            | Qualifikation      | Plan               | Organisation  |

      And I should see "31,75" within the header aggregation within the reports table

      And the "Von" field should contain "01.12.2012"
      And the "Bis" field should contain "31.12.2012"

     When I select "Sector 7-G" from the "Organisation" multiple-select box
      And I select "Homer Simpson" from the "Mitarbeiter" multiple-select box
      And I select "Uran rangieren" from the "Team" multiple-select box
      And I select "Shut down" from the "Plan" multiple-select box
      And I pick "17. November 2012" from "Von"
      And I pick "21. Dezember 2012" from "Bis"
      And I press "Filtern"
     Then I should see the following table of reports:
        | Datum       | Stunden  | Mitarbeiter     | Team            | Qualifikation      | Plan       | Organisation  |

      And I should see "9,00" within the header aggregation within the reports table
