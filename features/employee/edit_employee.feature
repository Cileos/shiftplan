  As a planner
  I want to edit employees

  Background:
    Given the situation of a just registered user
      And an employee "homer" exists with first_name: "Homer", last_name: "Simpson", account: the account, weekly_working_time: 40
      And a membership exists with organization: the organization, employee: the employee "homer"
     When I sign in as the confirmed user
      And I am on the employees page for the organization
     Then I should see the following table of employees:
        | Name            | WAZ  | E-Mail  | Status                 |
        | Simpson, Homer  | 40   |         | Noch nicht eingeladen  |

  Scenario: Editing an employee
    Given I follow "Simpson, Homer" within the employees table

  # Planners and owners should not be able to update their own role. We only test this
  # for owners here because specs exist for both planners and owners.
  Scenario: Owner can not update his own role
    # add owner mr. burns to organization
