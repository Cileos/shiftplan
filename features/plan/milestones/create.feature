Feature: create Milestones for a plan
  In order to achieve the goal of the plan
  As a planner
  I want to create milestones for a plan, containing a list of tasks

  Background:
   Given today is 2012-12-18
     And the situation of a nuclear reactor
     And I follow "neuer Meilenstein"

  Scenario: create a milestone with name only
    When I fill in "Name" with "World domination"
    Then no modal box should be open
    When I press "Anlegen"
     And I wait for the spinner to disappear
    Then I should see "World domination" within the milestones list
     And a milestone should exist with name: "World domination", plan: the plan
     And I should not see a field labeled "Name"

  Scenario: create a milestone with name and due date
    When I fill in "Name" with "World domination"
     And I fill in "F채llig am" with "2012-12-31"
     # to close the date picker
     And I press escape in the "F채llig am" field
     And I press "Anlegen"
     And I wait for the spinner to disappear
    Then a milestone should exist with name: "World domination", plan: the plan
     And the milestone's due_on should be "2012-12-31"

  Scenario: Failing to enter name shows validation error message
    When I press "Anlegen"
    Then I should see "muss ausgef체llt werden"
    When I fill in "Name" with "World Domination"
     And I press "Anlegen"
     # TODO we close the modal box on success, and the flash messages are in the modal box for now
     #Then I should see flash notice "Meilenstein erfolgreich angelegt"
    Then I should see "World Domination" within the milestones list
     And a milestone should exist with name: "World Domination"
     And I should not see a field labeled "Name"
     And I should not see "muss ausgef체llt werden"
