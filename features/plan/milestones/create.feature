Feature: create Milestones for a plan
  In order to achieve the goal of the plan
  As a planner
  I want to create milestones for a plan, containing a list of tasks

  Background:
   Given today is 2012-12-18
     And the situation of a nuclear reactor
     And I wait for 15 seconds
     And I follow "neuer Meilenstein"

  Scenario: create a milestone with name only
    When I fill in "Name" with "World Domination"
    Then I should not see "World Domination" within the milestones list
    When I press "Anlegen"
     And I wait for the modal box to disappear
    Then I should see "World Domination" within the milestones list
     And a milestone should exist with name: "World Domination", plan: the plan
     And I should not see a field labeled "Name"

  Scenario: create a milestone with name, due date, responsible and description
    When I fill in "Name" with "World Domination"
     And I pick "31. Dezember 2012" from "Fällig am"
     And I select "Homer S" from "Verantwortlicher"
     And I fill in "Beschreibung" with "must take over now!"
     And I press "Anlegen"
     And I wait for the spinner to disappear
    Then a milestone should exist with name: "World Domination", plan: the plan
     And the milestone's due_on should be "2012-12-31"
     And the milestone's description should be "must take over now!"
     And the employee "Homer" should be the milestone's responsible
     And I should see "Homer S" within the milestones list
     And I should see "must take over now" within the milestones list

  Scenario: Failing to enter name shows validation error message
    When I press "Anlegen"
    Then I should see "muss ausgefüllt werden"
    When I fill in "Name" with "World Domination"
     And I press "Anlegen"
     # TODO we close the modal box on success, and the flash messages are in the modal box for now
     #Then I should see flash notice "Meilenstein erfolgreich angelegt"
    Then I should see "World Domination" within the milestones list
     And a milestone should exist with name: "World Domination"
     And I should not see a field labeled "Name"
     And I should not see "muss ausgefüllt werden"
