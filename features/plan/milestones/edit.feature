    In order to fix typing mistakes or change of goals
    As a planner
    I want to edit te milestones

  Background:
   Given today is 2012-12-18
     And the situation of a nuclear reactor
     And a milestone exists with name: "Global Domination", plan: the plan
     And I am on the page of the plan "clean reactor"
    When I follow "Global Domination"

  Scenario: Edit an existing milestone
   Given I should see "Meilenstein bearbeiten" within the modal box header
    When I fill in "Name" with "World Domination"
     And I press "Speichern"
     And I wait for the modal box to disappear
     #Then I should see flash notice "Meilenstein erfolgreich ge채ndert"
    Then I should see "World Domination" within the milestones list
     But I should not see "Global Domination" within the milestones list
     And I should not see a field labeled "Name"
     And the milestone's name should be "World Domination"

  Scenario: Edit and cancel should rollback changes
    When I fill in "Name" with "Kindergarten"
     And I close the modal box
    Then I should see "Global Domination" within the milestones list
     And a milestone should exist with name: "Global Domination"
     But I should not see "Kindergarten" within the milestones list
     And 0 milestones should exist with name: "Kindergarten"


  # TODO revert changes/redisplay form if milestone invalid
  # Currently we directly edit the properties of the milestone, so they change
  # on the whole client. When get the invalid state by the RESTadapter, we
  # cannot rollback the changes and the 'edit' action was already exited.
