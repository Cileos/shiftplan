Feature: create a scheduling
  In order for my employees not to miss any of their shifts
  As a planner
  I want to create a scheduling for my employees

  Background:
    Given today is 2012-02-13
      And the situation of a nuclear reactor
      And I inject style "position:relative" into "header"

  @javascript
  Scenario: through the button on the top
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
     Then I should see "9-17 wichtige Arbeit [wA]" within a hint
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "9-17"
      And I press "Anlegen"
     Then I should see the following partial calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter  | Mo  | Di  | Mi           | Do  | Fr  | Sa  | So  |
        | Carl C       |     |     |              |     |     |     |     |
        | Lenny L      |     |     |              |     |     |     |     |
        | Homer S      |     |     | 09:00-17:00  |     |     |     |     |
     And the employee "Homer S" should have a yellow hours/waz value of "8 / 40"

     # completion
     When I inject style "position:relative" into "header"
      And I follow "Neue Terminierung"
      And I select "Lenny L" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "9"
      And I wait for the completion list to appear
      And I press arrow down in the "Quickie" field
      And I press return in the "Quickie" field
     Then the "Quickie" field should contain "9-17"

  @javascript
  Scenario: through the button on the top with repeating for checked days
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
     Then the "Mittwoch" checkbox should not be checked
      And the "Donnerstag" checkbox should not be checked
     When I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"

        | Lenny L     |    |    |             |             |    |    |    |
        | Homer S     |    |    | 09:00-17:00 | 09:00-17:00 |    |    |    |
     # TODO: editing
