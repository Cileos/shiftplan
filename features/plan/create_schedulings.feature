Feature: create a scheduling
  In order for my employees not to miss any of their shifts
  As a planner
  I want to create a scheduling for my employees

  Background:
    Given today is 2012-02-13
      And the situation of a nuclear reactor

  @javascript
  Scenario: just entering time span
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
     Then I should see "9-17 wichtige Arbeit [wA]" within a hint
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "9-17"
      And I press "Anlegen"
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter   | Mo | Di | Mi   | Do | Fr | Sa | So |
        | Carl C        |    |    |      |    |    |    |    |
        | Lenny L       |    |    |      |    |    |    |    |
        | Homer S       |    |    | 9-17 |    |    |    |    |
     And the employee "Homer S" should have a yellow hours/waz value of "8 / 40"

  @javascript
  Scenario: scheduling the same employee twice per day
    Given the employee "Homer" was scheduled in the plan as following:
        | date       | quickie |
        | 2012-02-15 | 9-17    |
      And I am on the page of the plan
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "18-23"
      And I press "Anlegen"
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter   | Mo | Di | Mi         | Do | Fr | Sa | So |
        | Carl C        |    |    |            |    |    |    |    |
        | Lenny L       |    |    |            |    |    |    |    |
        | Homer S       |    |    | 9-17 18-23 |    |    |    |    |

  @javascript
  Scenario: can only select employees being member of the current organization
    Given an organization "Jungle" exists with account: the account
      And an employee "tarzan" exists with first_name: "Tarzan", account: the account
      And a membership exists with organization: the organization "Jungle", employee: the employee "tarzan"
     When I go to the page of the plan "clean reactor"
     Then I should see "Homer S"
      And I should not see "Tarzan" within the calendar
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
      And I wait for the new scheduling form to appear
     Then I should not see "Tarzan" within the first form

  @javascript
  Scenario: just entering time span with javascript
     When I schedule "Homer S" on "Do" for "8-18"
     Then I should see the following calendar:

        | Carl C        |    |    |    |      |    |    |    |
