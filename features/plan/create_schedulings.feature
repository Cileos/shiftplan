Feature: create a scheduling
  In order for my employees not to miss any of their shifts
  As a planner
  I want to create a scheduling for my employees

  Background:
    Given today is 2012-02-13
      And the situation of a nuclear reactor


  @javascript
  Scenario: just entering time span
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
     Then I should see "9-17 wichtige Arbeit [wA]" within a hint
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "9-17"
      And I press "Anlegen"
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter   | Mo | Di | Mi   | Do | Fr | Sa | So |
        | Planner Burns |    |    |      |    |    |    |    |
        | Carl C        |    |    |      |    |    |    |    |

        | Homer S       |    |    | 9-17 |    |    |    |    |
     And the employee "Homer S" should have a yellow hours/waz value of "8 / 40"

  @javascript
  Scenario: scheduling the same employee twice per day
    Given the employee "Homer" was scheduled in the plan as following:
        | date       | quickie |
        | 2012-02-15 | 9-17    |
      And I am on the page of the plan

      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "18-23"
