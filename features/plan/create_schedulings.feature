Feature: create a scheduling
  In order for my employees not to miss any of their shifts
  As a planner
  I want to create a scheduling for my employees

  Background:
    Given today is 2012-02-13
      And the situation of a nuclear reactor


  Scenario: just entering time span
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "9-17"
      And I press "Anlegen"
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter | Montag | Dienstag | Mittwoch | Donnerstag | Freitag | Samstag | Sonntag |
        | Carl C      |        |          |          |            |         |         |         |
        | Lenny L     |        |          |          |            |         |         |         |
        | Homer S     |        |          | 9-17     |            |         |         |         |

  # TODO: currently it is assumend that a user can only have one organization
  Scenario: can only select employees from same planner (and organization)
    Given an organization "Jungle" exists
      And an employee exists with first_name: "Tarzan", organization: organization "Jungle"
    #  And an organization "Home" exists with planner: the planner
    #  And an employee exists with first_name: "Bart", organization: organization "Home"
     When I go to the page of the plan "clean reactor"
     Then I should see "Homer S"
     #  But I should not see "Bart"
      But I should not see "Tarzan" within the first form
      And I should not see "Tarzan" within the calendar


  @javascript
  Scenario: just entering time span with javascript
     When I schedule "Homer S" on "Donnerstag" for "8-18"
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter | Montag | Dienstag | Mittwoch | Donnerstag | Freitag | Samstag | Sonntag |
        | Carl C      |        |          |          |            |         |         |         |
        | Lenny L     |        |          |          |            |         |         |         |
        | Homer S     |        |          |          | 8-18       |         |         |         |
