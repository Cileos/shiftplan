Feature: create a scheduling
  In order for my employees not to miss any of their shifts
  As a planner
  I want to create a scheduling for my employees

  Background:
    Given today is 2012-02-13
      And the situation of a nuclear reactor

  Scenario: just entering time span
     When I follow "Neue Terminierung"
     Then I should see "9-17 wichtige Arbeit [wA]" within a hint
      And I select "Homer S" from "Mitarbeiter"
      And I select "Mittwoch" from "Wochentag"
      And I fill in "Quickie" with "9-17"
      And I press "Anlegen"
     Then I should see the following calendar:
        | Mitarbeiter   | Montag | Dienstag | Mittwoch | Donnerstag | Freitag | Samstag | Sonntag |
        | Planner Burns |        |          |          |            |         |         |         |
