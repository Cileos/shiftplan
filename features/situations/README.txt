A Situation is a collection of steps usually helping to setup Scenarios with common backgrounds.

Please follow the following guidelines:

 * before creating a new Situation, try to find a already existing one that fits and optionally add your specific step
 * if you create a new one, make sure its name describes exactly what the situation is, so the other developer(s) do not HAVE to read it all over (again)
 * try to describe a predictable Situation - for us is this the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and all its employees and environmentals factors. Please think thrice before inventing a new universe
